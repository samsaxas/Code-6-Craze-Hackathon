# Code-6-Craze-Hackathon
The Code-6-Craze hackathon was an exciting inter-departmental event at the college level, bringing together students to compete and collaborate on innovative projects. This hackathon provided a unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, fostering creativity and teamwork. Throughout the event, I learned a lotâ€”from improving coding skills to enhancing problem-solving abilities. The experience was both challenging and rewarding, offering valuable insights and a deeper understanding of the power of collaboration and technology.


## Problem Statement
Social media platforms have become a critical venue for users to express their opinions, share experiences, and engage in discussions. Understanding and analyzing these sentiments can provide valuable insights for businesses, policymakers, and researchers. With the vast amount of data generated daily, effective data visualization techniques are essential for interpreting and communicating these insights.
Design and implement a comprehensive data visualization solution for social media sentiment analysis. The system should enable users to upload datasets, view statistics, and generate various types of visualizations to explore sentiment data. The visualizations must be interactive and customizable, allowing users to select specific attributes, graph types, and styles. The solution should provide a user-friendly front-end interface coupled with a robust back-end system to process and visualize the data efficiently.

## Brief Approach
This project aims to bridge the gap between raw sentiment data and actionable insights through intuitive data visualization. By combining a user-friendly interface with powerful back-end processing, the solution will empower users to make informed decisions based on social media sentiment analysis.
